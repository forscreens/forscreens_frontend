    The EditableActorInformationForm component uses Formik's Form and Field components (or in your case, MUI's TextField with Formik's useFormik hook) to manage the form state and submission process.

    When the form is submitted, Formik gathers all form values and passes them to the onSubmit callback, which in this case is the handleFormSubmit function.

    The handleFormSubmit function then handles the actual logic you want to perform with the form values, such as updating the local state, making an API call, navigating the user, etc.

In this setup:

    Formik handles:
        Tracking form values.
        Validation (if you provide validation logic).
        Form submission event (gathers values and calls the provided onSubmit function).

    You handle:
        The logic inside the handleFormSubmit function (what to do with the form values).

This separation of concerns allows you to focus on your specific form logic while Formik takes care of the tedious parts of form management.
