## Overview

The `useAPIUpdate` is a custom React hook designed to handle API updates. It provides a method to submit data to an API endpoint, along with the current loading state and any errors encountered during the data submission process.

## Imports

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import { submitData } from "./SubmitAPI";
```

## Hook's States

- **isLoading**: A boolean state indicating if the data is currently being submitted to the API.
- **error**: Stores any error messages that might occur during the submission process.

## The useAPIUpdate Hook

When invoked, the hook provides the following:

### handleAPIUpdate

An asynchronous function that handles the process of updating data to the API.

#### Parameters:

- **type**: Describes the type or nature of the data being submitted.
- **data**: The actual data that needs to be submitted.

#### Functionality:

1. It sets `isLoading` to `true` indicating the start of the submission process.
2. Resets any previously set error.
3. Tries to submit the data using the `submitData` function from `SubmitAPI`.
4. On success, it sets `isLoading` to `false` and returns the result of the submission.
5. If an error occurs, `isLoading` is set to `false` and the error message is stored.
