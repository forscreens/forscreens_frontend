# Documentation: ProfilePage Component

## Overview

The `ProfilePage` component serves as a comprehensive view for actor profiles. It incorporates various sub-components, which together present details, media, highlights, and other relevant data about the actor.

## Imports

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFormik } from 'formik';
import { Box } from '@mui/material';
import backgroundImage1 from '../../assets/images/appbar_background1.png';
import overlayImage from '../../assets/images/overlay_image.png';
import ResponsiveBoxUserComment from './components/ResponsiveBoxUserComment';
import ActorTabs from './components/ActorTabs';
import ActorInfo from './components/ActorInfo';
import styles from './ActorPage.module.css';
import useFetchUserData from '../../components/hooks/useFetchUserData';
import ProfileInfoBox from './components/ProfileInfoBox';
import ActorHeader from './components/ActorHeader';
```

### Key Imports:
- **useFormik**: An external library hook to manage form state and operations.
- **useFetchUserData**: A custom hook to fetch user data from a specified API endpoint.
- **ActorHeader, ActorInfo, ProfileInfoBox, ActorTabs, ResponsiveBoxUserComment**: Component imports that contribute to the overall layout and functionality of the `ProfilePage`.

## State and Data Management

1. **useState and useEffect**: These hooks are used to manage and initialize local component states, especially for controlling data fetched from the API.
2. **useFetchUserData**: This hook fetches data for the user. It returns the fetched data, loading state, error state, and a setData function to update the fetched data.
3. **useFormik**: This is utilized to handle form operations, although in the current state of the component, it's initialized but not actively used for any specific form.

## Core Functionality

1. **Data Retrieval**: Data for the actor is fetched using the `useFetchUserData` hook. If the data isn't retrieved yet, a loading placeholder is displayed.
2. **Data Display**: Once the data is fetched, it's passed down to various components (`ActorHeader`, `ProfileInfoBox`, and `ActorInfo`) to display the data to users.
3. **Data Update**: When data within these components is updated, the changes are propagated back to the `ProfilePage` component using callback functions. The primary function for this is `handleUserDataChange`.

## Layout and Styling

The component uses a combination of Material-UI's Box component and CSS modules (through `styles`) for styling and layout. The page is designed to have a flexible layout, with a header, tabs, and a two-grid system for displaying profile information.

## Tabs and Navigation

The `ActorTabs` component provides navigation within the `ProfilePage`. Depending on the tab selected, different views or components are rendered.

## Future Updates

1. **Extend Data Fields**: As the actor's schema expands or changes, you may need to adjust the initial data fetching and propagation mechanism.
2. **Enhance Form Management**: If form operations become more complex, consider further leveraging `formik` to manage form states, validation, and submission.
3. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling mechanisms, possibly providing users with more informative error messages or recovery options.
4. **Styling and Theming**: For visual alterations, modify the styles in `ActorPage.module.css` or adjust the `sx` prop values within the components.

## Export

The component is exported as a default export, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
