## NavBar Component Documentation

### Introduction
The `NavBar` component provides a navigation bar for the application, integrating various links for navigation and a sign-in button for user authentication.

### Dependencies

1. **React** - The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. **React-Bootstrap** - A frontend framework, which provides a set of React components that implement the Bootstrap framework.
3. **React-Router-Dom** - A routing library for React, which allows navigation between different components.
4. **NavBar.css** - A custom CSS file to style the component.

### Component Structure

The component has the following structure:

1. **Navbar** - A container component that wraps the entire navigation bar.
2. **Container** - A bootstrap component that provides a responsive fixed width container.
3. **Navbar.Brand** - Represents the branding logo for the application.
4. **Navbar.Toggle** - A button component used to collapse or expand the navbar items on smaller screens.
5. **Navbar.Collapse** - A container that holds the navigation links and collapses/expands based on the screen size or user interaction.
6. **Nav** - A container for holding the individual navigation links.
7. **Nav.Link** - Represents individual navigation links.
8. **Button** - A sign-in button that redirects the user to the login page.

### Component Functionality

1. **State Management**: The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of the navbar, specifically whether it's expanded or collapsed.
2. **Navigation Links**: The navigation links navigate to different sections of the application or website.
3. **Sign-In Button**: This button redirects the user to the login page.

### Interactivity

1. **handleNavbarToggle()**: Toggles the navbar's expanded state when the user clicks on the navbar toggle button.
2. **handleLinkClick()**: Collapses the navbar when a navigation link or the sign-in button is clicked.

### Updating for User Authentication
To change the "Sign In" button to a "Profile" page link upon successful user login:

1. Introduce a state or prop that checks if the user is authenticated, such as `isLoggedIn`.
2. Based on the `isLoggedIn` state, conditionally render the "Sign In" button or a link to the "Profile" page.

```jsx
{!isLoggedIn ? (
  <Link to="/login">
    <Button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={handleLinkClick}>
      Sign In
    </Button>
  </Link>
) : (
  <Link to="/profile" onClick={handleLinkClick}>
    Profile
  </Link>
)}
```

This will ensure that if a user is logged in, they will see a "Profile" link instead of the "Sign In" button.

### How to Update

1. **Add New Links**: To add new navigation links, simply add another `<Nav.Link>` component inside the `<Nav>` container.
2. **Styling**: For any styling updates, refer to the `NavBar.css` file.
3. **Authentication Flow**: If there's a change in how user authentication works, you might need to adjust the logic that conditionally renders the "Sign In" button or the "Profile" link.
4. **Responsive Behavior**: The responsiveness is handled by the React-Bootstrap components. If there's a need for more custom responsiveness, you can adjust the Bootstrap breakpoints or use custom CSS/media queries in the `NavBar.css` file.
